# Pizzeria

Hey there, another tiny Java program here! You get to manage your own pizza restaurant :)

There are 2 types of pizza, Common and Super (with more than 10 ingredients) one.

The program main functions are:
- adding a pizza
- finding pizzas without the ingredient chosen by you
- finding pizzas with greater price than the one in input
- finding the ingredients of a pizza searched by its name
- showing the list of Super Pizzas
- showing the cheapest pizza in the menu

Enjoy!
